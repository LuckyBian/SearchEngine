# SearchEngine
This project is based on java and spring boot to complete a search engine that allows users to get relevant web pages by entering keywords. 
The first stage of the project is to carry out the collection of data. 
This phase uses multi-threading to improve collection efficiency and uses etymology, stopword, mapping and other methods to save storage space. 
The second phase of the project is a web search, consisting of a single keyword search and a two keyword search. 
The final web page information is displayed by spring boot.
